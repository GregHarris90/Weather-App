# The Repository

* LINK TO LIVE REPOSITORY*

https://gregharris90.github.io/Weather-App/

- This repository is for a web application to use a 'Weather Application' to search for a city and retrieve the weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV (ultra-violet) index, and see the next 5 day forecast. 

# User Story

- On the main page the user finds a search bar at the top left asking for a city name.

- Once a city name is input push the button to pull up data on that city. 

- The searched city will be added to a list of search history below the search bar.

- In the main section of the page information about the city will be displayed. 

- Showing City/Date, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and UV Index.

- Then below at the bottom of the page the forecast for the next 5 days is also shared. 

- Hopefully this helps the user find out the weather of a city to better make plans.

# Overall Conclusion

- This homework assignment has definitely been the most difficult one so far, as I still am trying to get better with Javascript and Jquery. I seem to understand the API calls and extracting information from them while also using local storage. But the challenge here has mostly been getting everything working with my Javascript and using it to display information on the webpage. 

*I've almost completed all the requirements, I just need to finish my 5 day forecast and fix an issue with my buttons that generate under the search bar*
